        `Victoria Wool Processor Group was established by its founder and current Managing Director Jim Kim in 1983 when he came to Australia to source processed wool for export to the rest of the world. Frustrated by what he considered to be inferior quality in processing and high cost he established his own processing business in 1990 in Melbourne with a second-hand machine.\n
        Building a skilful team and producing a quality product meant volumes increased to such an extent that he built a purposely built new facility in 2002 about 3 km from the old site.\n
        The new site is closest wool processing plant to the Port of Melbourne which is the busiest container port in Australia and can take advantage of Melbourne’s clean water supply to supply white bright 100% Australian carbonised wool.\n
        Operating 24 hours per day with state of the art equipment backed by skilled technicians VWP offers first class processing for international and domestic wool customers.\n
        This is backed by a first rate team of experienced wool buyers who specialise in wool types best suited to carbonised wool to ensure that its customers get the wool they require at the right price to the right specifications and on time.\n
        At all stages of the operation, VWP staff are there to ensure that your wool will receive the attention that it deserves.`

        p:
        `
        As the Australian wool industry has lost all but a few remaining wool processing plants, VWP has continued to expand and improve its productivity. Installing the latest technology combined with our ‘own’ internal engineering initiatives. We pride ourselves on both our productivity rates and our optimisation of both power and water which enables us to remain competitive in the textile industry which has largely been relocated overseas in search of cheaper ‘production’ costs.\n
        In 2002 we relocated to a completely new site constructing a new factory, office and warehouse purpose built to suit our expanding business. Since then modifications have been regularly made ensuring we can continually deliver on our belief that our product is absolute first class, a reputation we have gained and maintained.\n
        Our customers enjoy a friendly yet professional service that always delivers.\n
